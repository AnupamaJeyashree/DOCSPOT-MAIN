               In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases. Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. As it is predicted that India is yet to reach the peak of outbreak, there is really a need for tracking the available number of ICU beds to treat the infected people.  In this project, our idea is to develop an mobile application that can track the availability of ICU beds nearer to the location of the patient. The plan is to track the data of both public and private hospitals.
