            <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
            <p class="text">
<b>Introduction</b><br>
   Docspot is an online community where patients, doctors and hospitals learn from each other. Docspot is committed to protecting the privacy of our users.<br><br>
<b>Scope</b><br>
   This Privacy Policy explains how Docspot handles and protects your information. It does not address how your information may be protected, used, or disclosed by anyone else with whom you choose to share it.<br><br>
<b>Collection of your Personal Information</b><br><br>
<b>Information Collected from All Visitors to our Website</b><br>
We may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to help us verify your identity upon return visits to Docspot, improve your user experience with our services, and improve and measure the effectiveness of our products. As background, cookies are small text files that websites can send to your browser, which your computer stores, that can automatically collect server domain names, IP addresses, type of computer, type of browser, and information about what pages are visited. You can set your browser to decline cookies or notify you before accepting cookies, although if you decline them, the website may not function properly.<br><br>
<b>Information Collected from Users Who Choose to Create an Account</b><br>
When you create a Smart Patients account, you may be asked for certain personal information such as your name, address, phone, email address, etc. It is important that you provide accurate information to facilitate our communications with you. You will also create a password. We will protect this information, and we will use and disclose it only in the ways we describe in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
<b>Access to Your Information</b><br>
You can view the information you have submitted into your active Smart Patients account at any time. If you submitted information to us in any way other than through the website, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to give you access to your information upon request.<br><br>
<b>Deletion of Your Information</b><br>
If you delete information from your Smart Patients account, it becomes immediately inaccessible by you and cannot be viewed by any other user on the Smart Patients website. Similarly, if you close your account, all of your information will become immediately inaccessible by you. For a limited time after data deletion or account termination, backup systems at Smart Patients may still contain the data, although reconstructing it in an identifiable format might not be possible or feasible.<br> Of course, if you have already shared information through Smart Patients with third parties that have already saved it, the information will persist in their records. We do not have access to or control over anything you choose to share with third parties.<br><br>
<b>Security</b><br>
We are committed to maintaining the security of personal information. We use appropriate technical, administrative, and physical controls to protect personal information from loss, misuse, or alteration. If we share personal information with vendors, we subject them to strict contractual and legal controls regarding the protection, use, and disclosure of the information. If we share anonymous or de-identified data with third parties, we will contractually require them to keep it in de-identified form and forbid them to make any attempt to re-identify the data or allow others to do so.<br> There is always some risk that unauthorized, wrongful, or illegal access to your information could occur or that data sent over the Internet could be intercepted. We urge you to take strong precautions to protect your password. <br><br>
<b>How You Can Help Protect Your Privacy</b><br>
Don’t use your name, email address, or anything linkable to your name unless you want everything you post, and others post about you, to be identified with you. Protect your password. Don’t upload your picture unless you are certain you want it to be shared. Be aware that although our Terms of Agreement require users to respect the confidentiality of posts by other users within their community groups, it is possible that users might violate the Terms and disclose your information outside the Docspot website. Please keep that in mind as you decide what information to post. <br><br>
<b>Updates</b><br>
We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time, although we expect that most changes will only be editorial in nature or reflect changes in the services we offer. However, in the unlikely event that we would ever make material changes that would permit us to share your information more broadly than we have previously described, we would ask you to consent to the new Privacy Policy before it applied to you. If you did not consent, many of the features offered by the Site would be unavailable to you. <br><br>
<b>Advertising</b><br>
We will not post advertising on the Smart Patients website. A user who attempts to post advertising on the website is violating our Terms of Agreement and is subject to sanctions under our Terms of Agreement.<br><br>
<b>Effective Date</b><br>
This Privacy Policy is effective October 30, 2020.
